<h3> MITIGATION </h3>

<h2> Mitigation is  the action of reducing the severity, seriousness, or painfulness of something.</h2>
<h2> For Earthquakes, Brgy. Pembo, Makati City is in line with West Valley Faults The West Valley Fault is 100 kilometers in length and traverses the cities of Metro Manila namely Taguig, Muntinlupa, Paranaque, Quezon City, Pasig, Makati, and Marikina as well as nearby provinces of Rizal, Laguna, Cavite, and Bulacan. These places will suffer greatly when this fault moves. And when it did, it could generate a 7.2 magnitude earthquake causing great devastation of the most progressive portion of the Metro Manila.</h2>

<h2>According to DOST - PHIVOLCS this fault moves every 200 â€“ 400 years and the last time it did was in the year 1658, that was 359 years ago.</h2>
<h2> The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) is the one that studies and caters all the phenomenon of earthquakes and volcanoes. Using mitigation, if they are able to see the activities on the volcano or earthquakes, they will inform the Local Governments and The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) to be aware and perform their duty to make the people safe.</h2>
<h2> The most logical solution to prevent casualties to people near the fault line  or in the fault line is to find another  location of their home or business.  Evacuate their home and locate their business to another place as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Let assume these situation:</h2>
<h2>PAGASA will inform the Local Government about the upcoming typhoon</h2>
<h2>Local Government will task people to evacuate to prevent casualties</h2>
<h2>People are informed before why they will evacuate to the evacuation centers</h2>
